                    <h3>Introduction Go</h3>
                </header>
                    <p>The Go Programming Language first appeared in the last 13 years. Go which was formerly called Golang
                        is a statically typed and compiled programming language. According to wikipedia Go was designed
                        by Google in 2007 because the designers wanted to improve on the flaws of the language C++. 
                        When making Go they wanted to take elements from other languages that they want to keep.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Static typing and run-time efficiency(like C)</li>
                        <li>Readability and usability (like JavaScript)</li>
                        <li>High-performance networking and multiprocessing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. 
                        Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines,
                        while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. 
                        Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.
                        It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

                </header>
                    <p>You are expected to know the following information to be able to use go efficiently. 
                        That being said you can do your own research to bridge the gap that might not be present. 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Beginner to intermediate experience in programming</strong>,
                        Although the syntax is relatively simple, it is helpful to understand common
                        programming practices. </li>
                        <li><strong>Usage of an IDE(Integrated Development Environment)</strong>
                        Usage of a text editor or IDE like VScode to write your code.</li>
                        <li><strong>A CLI(Command Line Interface)</strong>Go works well when used with 
                        a CLI like Powershell(windows), Linux or Mac terminal. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With the above experience you should be able to begin writing code and setting up the environment
                        for go programming.

                    <h3>About Golang</h3>
                </header>
                    <p>Although common for non-malicious uses Go has seen a rise of popularity among malware authors
                        and APTs(Advanced Persistent Threats). According to zdnet, Go has been widely adopted by malware authors for 
                        the three following reasons.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>"The first is that Go supports an easy process for cross-platform compilation. 
                                This allows malware developers to write code once and compile binaries from the same codebase for multiple platforms, 
                                allowing them to target Windows, Mac, and Linux from the same codebase, 
                                a versatility that they don't usually have with many other programming languages."</li>
                            <li>"The second reason is that Go-based binaries are still hard to analyze and reverse engineer by security researchers, 
                                which has kept detection rates for Go-based malware very low."</li>
                            <li>"The third reason is related to Go's support for working with network packets and requests.
                                Since malware strains usually tamper, assemble, or send/receive network packets all the time, 
                                Go provides malware devs with all the tools they need in one place."
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Open the MSI file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.
                            By default the installer will install Go to 
                            Program Files or Program Files (x86). You can change the location as needed.
                            After installing, you will need to close and reopen any open command prompts
                            to ensure that the changes to the environment made by the installer are reflected
                            in the command prompt.
                        </li>
                        <li> Now we need to verify that we have installed Go.

                            The package installs the Go distribution to <code>/usr/local/go</code> <br>
                            The package should put the <code>/usr/local/go/bin</code> directory in your PATH environment variable.
                            You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

                </header>
                    <p>Lets start writing code, we will begin by printing <em>Hello World!</em> in the programming tradition.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open a CLI and cd to your ~(home) directory.<br>
                        On Linux or Mac use:<br>
                    <code>cd ~</code><br>On Windows use:<br><code>$ cd %HOMEPATH%</code></li>
                    <li>Create a Hello directory for your first Go source code.<br>
                        For example, use the following commands:<br>
                    <code>$ mkdir hello</code><br>
                    <code>$ cd hello</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Enable dependency tracking for your code.<br>
                        When your code imports packages contained in other modules, 
                        you manage those dependencies through your code's own module.
                        That module is defined by a go.mod file that tracks the modules that provide those packages. 
                        That go.mod file stays with your code, including in your source code repository.<br>
                        To enable dependency tracking for your code by creating a go.mod file, run the
                        <code>$ go mod init</code> command giving it the name of the module your code will be in.
                        The name is the module's module path.<br>
                        In actual development, the module path will typically
                        be the repository location where your source code will be kept.
                        For example, the module path might be <i>github.com/mymodule</i>. 
                        If you plan to publish your module for others to use, the module path <i>must</i>
                        be a location from which Go tools can download your module.<br>
                        For the purposes of this tutorial, just use example/hello.<br>
                        <code>$ go mod init example/hello</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>in your text editor, create a file <i>hello.go</i> in which to write your code.</li>
                    <li>Paste the following code into your <i>hello.go</i> file and save the file.
                    <code><br>
                        package main<br><br>

                        import "fmt"<br><br>
                        
                        func main() {<br>
                            fmt.Println("Hello, World!")<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code>  
                        This is your Go code. In this code you:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions, 
                                and it's made up of all the files in the same directory).</li>
                            <li>Import the popular fmt package, which contains functions for formatting text, 
                                including printing to the console.This package is one of the standard library 
                                packages you got when you installed Go.</li>
                            <li>Implement a main function to print a message to the console. 
                                A main function executes by default when you run the main package.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Run your code to see the greeting.<br>
                    <code>$ go run . <br>
                    Hello, World!</code><br><br>
                    The go run command is one of many go commands you'll use to get things done with Go. 
                    Use the following command to get a list of the others:<br>
